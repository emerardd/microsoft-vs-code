*"What if debugging was an actual battle?"*

Transform your coding workflow into an epic arcade shooter! Deploy your project by defeating bugs, syntax errors, and the dreaded legacy code monoliths. Each wave brings new challenges as you refactor your way to version 1.0... and beyond.

## 🎯 Features

### 🕹️ **Authentic VS Code Experience**
- **Pixel-Perfect UI**: Lovingly recreated VS Code interface with activity bar, sidebar, editor tabs, terminal, and status bar
- **Interactive Sidebars**:
  - 📁 **Explorer** - View project stats and release progress
  - 🔍 **Search** - Browse enemy database with detailed info
  - 🌿 **Git** - Track your commit history through waves
  - 🐛 **Debug** - Monitor performance metrics, combos, and high score
  - 🧩 **Extensions** - Check your installed power-ups and upgrades
  - ⚙️ **Settings** - Tune movement sensitivity and toggle sound

### ⚔️ **Intense Gameplay**
- **9 Unique Enemy Types**: From basic bugs 🪲 to merge conflicts ⚠️ to the terrifying MONOLITH boss
- **Boss Phase 2**: Monolith enters a rage state below 50% HP — colour shift, faster tracking shot, and a 3-way shotgun burst
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Waves get harder with smarter enemies and epic boss battles
- **Combo System**: Chain kills for massive score multipliers
- **Local High Score**: Best run is saved to your browser and shown on the start screen and game-over screen
- **Power-Ups**:
  - ☕ **Coffee** - Speed boost
  - 🤖 **GitHub Copilot** - Weapon upgrade
  - 🐳 **Docker** - Temporary shield
  - 🩹 **Hotfix** - Restore 30 HP

### 📦 **Wave Upgrade System**
After defeating each Boss a three-choice upgrade screen appears. Pick one permanent enhancement for the rest of the run:

| Upgrade | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| ⚡ Compiler Upgrade | TypeScript compiler +1 level (more projectiles) |
| ❤️ Heap Expansion | Max HP +25 and full heal |
| 📦 Buffer Overflow | Magazine size +10 |
| ⚙️ Fast GC | Reload time reduced 30% |
| 🔥 Overclock CPU | Permanent fire rate boost |

### 🎨 **Polished Mechanics**
- **Advanced Weapon System**:
  - Ammo management with auto-reload
  - TypeScript Compiler upgrades (up to level 5)
  - Ultimate "Refactor" ability (Press R/Shift)
- **WebAudio Sound Effects**: Synthesised SFX for shooting, hits, explosions, power-ups, heals, Boss appearance, Refactor ultimate, and wave clear — with a mutable toggle in the status bar and Settings panel
- **Visual Effects**:
  - Particle explosions on enemy destruction
  - Floating damage numbers
  - Hit flash feedback
  - Animated combo meter
- **Readable Combat HUD**:
  - Compact player HP/max display integrated into the canvas HUD
  - Boss health bar with Phase 2 warning label
- **Frame-Rate Independent Movement**: Player, enemies, projectiles, and timers scale with real frame time for consistent gameplay across all machines

## 🎮 Game Mechanics

### Controls
```
WASD       → Move your player
SPACE      → Shoot TypeScript bullets
SHIFT / R  → Refactor Ultimate (when charged)
ESC / P    → Pause game
```

On touch devices, the game area shows directional, fire, and refactor controls. Activity-bar buttons open a dismissible mobile sidebar.

### Accessibility / Tuning
- Open the **Settings** sidebar from the gear icon in the activity bar
- Adjust **Movement Sensitivity** from `0.5x` to `2.0x`
- Toggle **Sound Effects** on/off — or click the 🔔 icon in the status bar
- Slider focus is automatically released after dragging so keyboard control returns to gameplay

### Objective
Survive increasingly difficult waves of coding errors and deploy your project! Each wave requires you to:
1. **Defeat enemies** to fill the Release Progress bar
2. **Face boss battles** when the bar is full
3. **Choose an upgrade** after defeating the Boss
4. **Collect power-ups** to enhance your abilities
5. **Maintain combos** for score multipliers

### Enemy Roster

| Enemy | Symbol | HP | Points | Behavior |
|-------|--------|----|----|----------|
| **Bug** | 🪲 | 10 | 100 | Basic enemy, swarms in numbers |
| **Syntax Error** | `};` | 20 | 200 | Tanky but slow |
| **Spaghetti Code** | `goto` | 15 | 150 | Fast and erratic |
| **Memory Leak** | `malloc()` | 40 | 300 | Grows in size over time |
| **404 Error** | `404` | 15 | 250 | Extremely fast |
| **Merge Conflict** | `<<<<` | 35 | 350 | Splits into smaller enemies on death |
| **Infinite Loop** | `while(1)` | 25 | 400 | Spiral attack pattern |
| **Race Condition** | `async` | 20 | 500 | Teleports randomly |
| **MONOLITH** 👹 | `LegacyWrapper` | 600 | 5000 | Boss: tracking shots, minion spawns, Phase 2 shotgun burst |

### Progression System
- **Weapon Levels**: Collect Copilot power-ups or choose the Compiler Upgrade to level up (max 5)
- **Ammo System**: 40 bullets max (expandable), auto-regenerates slowly, reload time 2.5s (reducible)
- **Special Meter**: Charges by defeating enemies, unleash "Refactor" to clear the screen
- **Wave System**: Difficulty scales each version release (v1.0, v2.0, v3.0…)
- **High Score**: Persisted locally via `localStorage`, displayed on start and game-over screens

### Tech Stack

- **React 19.2** - UI framework
- **TypeScript 5.8** - Type safety
- **Vite 8.1** - Build tool and dev server
- **HTML5 Canvas** - Game rendering
- **Web Audio API** - Procedural sound effects
- **CSS3 / Tailwind 3** - Locally compiled VS Code styling with no runtime CDN
- **Vitest / ESLint** - Pure game-logic tests and static quality gates

### Key Components

#### `GameEngine.tsx`
Coordinates the game runtime:
- Time-scaled game loop for frame-rate independent gameplay
- Mutable entity state and `requestAnimationFrame` lifecycle
- Spawn, combat, progression, and upgrade coordination
- Delegates input, collisions, enemy behaviour, and drawing to focused modules
- Wave upgrade trigger → `GameState.UPGRADE`

#### `game/` modules
- `useGameInput.ts` owns keyboard listener setup, cleanup, and pause handling
- `entityFactory.ts` creates enemies, bosses, projectiles, power-ups, and effects
- `advanceEntities.ts` advances projectiles, particles, and floating text
- `canvasViewport.ts` keeps Canvas text sharp across display pixel densities
- `minimap.ts` projects the complete playable area into the reserved telemetry rail
- `combat.ts` resolves contact, projectile damage, pickups, and entity cleanup
- `playerSystem.ts` owns movement, status timers, ammo, reload, and shooting
- `progression.ts` owns defeat rewards, combos, boss completion, and upgrade choices
- `refactorUltimate.ts` owns activation and damage for the ultimate ability
- `upgrades.ts` applies selected wave upgrades and permanent run modifiers
- `updateEnemy.ts` owns enemy movement, special behaviour, and boss phases
- `collision.ts` provides shared collision primitives
- `contentSelection.ts` owns weighted random content selection
- `renderScene.ts` owns Canvas drawing and visual effects

#### `App.tsx`
Handles the VS Code interface:
- Activity bar navigation
- Dynamic sidebar views (Explorer, Search, Git, Debug, Extensions, Settings)
- Wave upgrade overlay (three-choice card UI)
- High score persistence via `localStorage`
- Terminal log display
- Start / game-over screens
- Sound toggle

#### `utils/audio.ts`
Lightweight procedural audio:
- No external files — all sounds synthesised with `OscillatorNode` and white noise
- Global mute toggle
- Functions: `sfxShoot`, `sfxHit`, `sfxExplosion`, `sfxPowerUp`, `sfxHeal`, `sfxBossAppear`, `sfxUltimate`, `sfxPlayerHit`, `sfxWaveClear`

## 🎨 Customization

### Modify Enemy Difficulty

Edit `constants.ts`:

```typescript
export const ENEMY_TYPES = [
  {
    type: 'BUG',
    text: '🪲',
    hp: 10,        // Increase for tankier bugs
    score: 100,    // Adjust point values
    speed: 1.5,    // Higher = faster
    color: '#f14c4c',
    width: 24,
    desc: '普通Bug，数量众多'
  },
  // Add your own enemies!
]
```

### Adjust Game Balance

```typescript
// constants.ts
export const PLAYER_SPEED = 5;             // Movement speed
export const MAX_AMMO = 40;                // Ammo capacity
export const AMMO_REGEN = 0.4;             // Regen per frame
export const SPECIAL_CHARGE_PER_KILL = 5;  // Ultimate charge rate
```

### Add New Upgrades

```typescript
// constants.ts
export const UPGRADE_OPTIONS = [
  {
    id: 'MY_UPGRADE',
    icon: '🔥'
  }
]
```

Adding an enemy requires more than its config: extend `EnemyType` in `types.ts`, add EN/ZH strings for its `descKey`, include it in the wave spawn distribution in `game/contentSelection.ts`, implement any special AI in `game/updateEnemy.ts`, and finish with `npm run verify`.

Then complete all four integration points:

1. Add `'MY_UPGRADE'` to the `UpgradeId` union in `types.ts`.
2. Add `upg_MY_UPGRADE_title` and `upg_MY_UPGRADE_desc` to both language maps in `utils/i18n.ts`.
3. Handle the effect in the `applyUpgrade` switch inside `game/upgrades.ts`:

```typescript
case 'MY_UPGRADE':
  // Your custom logic here
  break;
```

4. Add a test for the effect and run `npm run verify`.
